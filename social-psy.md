# Small adventures in psycology

- Fundamental Attriubution Error is the tendency of people to judge one's kind (and traits) instead of context (and state). Basically, thinking that someone did something because it is who they **are**, not what the context as a whole has made of them. Better put: *to underestimate the impact of situational factors and to overestimate the role of dispositional factors in controlling behaviour*
- Actorâ€“observer asymmetry seems to have something to do with it. When the action comes from us, we are biased to try to put the weight on the situation; whether when it comes from an external actor (such as a coworker or a friend) we tend to judge the dispositional factors ("that is because of who he is"). This happens because we can look into ourselves and so judge the whole situation, whereas looking inside another person is harder or even impossible - they are "less accessible".
- Self-serving bias is what is known when we push something to keep a high self-esteem. For instance, when we believe that what we conquer comes from effort, but deem our failure to be a consequence of external factors.

## Self-esteem

- Self-esteem  can be viewed in many ways. One way is "self-esteem is a judgemental value on one's self-concept". However, there are deeper views.
- We could possibly separate self esteem between two types: trait self-esteem and state self-esteem.
	- trait self-esteem (aka global self-esteem) is how we normally feel about the self worthiness from a continum perspective. as the term **trait** indicates, it's more about a continum, how we generally feel
	- state self-esteem is how we feel momentarily about our self-worth (when we get a promotion, when we get a divorce, etc). this may also be called the feelings of self worth. as the term **state** indicates, it is something  of momentum

### Terror management theory 

- The reason why we need self esteem is blurred. One of the theories is calles TMT, or **terror management theory**. It has been shown that having elevated self-esteem (thus self-worth) drives one away from the anxiety of our unstopable death. The drawing they do is a buffer: we have a anxiety deeply rooted in us, but we instead fullfill this with our self-esteem. That is why it's terror management: out self-esteem is a shield from the terror rooted in axiety. We create a **symbolic immorality** as opposed to the **literal immorality** (proposed by religion, after-life, heaven, etc) based on cultural constructions. We then create a sense of self-concept and do a **judgmenetal value** of such based on that which deviates us from the imminent death treat. 
- Each of us puts a) a validity of the cultural worldview and b) judge if we are living up to such standards proposed by that culture/worldview.
- The self-esteem builds uppon being this buffer for self-esteem early in life. As newborns, we are helpless; and therefore rely on our parents to make us stay alive. We have an innate fear of death, so we try to hold up to those standards in order to not die. That's when we acquire the parents version of the culture & worldview - then, our self-esteem, and it acts as a buffer for this innate anxiety of the discontinuation of our life.
- An interesting quote about it: *"one is an object of primary value in a world of meaningful action"*.
- Self-esteem is not only a shield of the iminent death treat. It also serves good for mental and phisical health; and it does give the "good feeling" one thinks is necessary.
- **Mortality salience** is the awarness of the death and that it is innevitable. This, according to TMT, brings anxiety; which in turn is shielded with self-esteem (the value of one-self measured accordingly to the cultural context in which they are involved). This can lead to a worldview defense mechanism, and a higher punishment on transgressions: if we value our esteem based on a cultural view, we must defend it to have the actual self-worth. If our sense of self-esteem is low, we must highly punish small transgressions because we want to defend our worldview at all costs. Sauce: https://www.apa.org/pubs/books/431700E
- Another interesting point about **MS** is that reminders of it lead to a pursuit of the psycologycal structure for defense. Meaning: constant reminders of death lead to a pursuit of living up to worldview standards (which leads to higher self-esteem).
- Belonging to a group (in Maslow's theory, one of the D-needs that comes before esteem) also has something to do with **MS**. There's a theory called **optimal distinctiviness** which says we try to balance how much we belong to a group and how much we are different from it. It is a continum and the theory states we try to stay in an optimal place. This equilibrium brings "good points" when judging the self-esteem (again: judgemental value over the self-concept)
- One other thing that may observed as well is **self-serving bias**, which is when we attribute good things to our trait selves and bad things to the situation - the opposite for others. This correlates in a certain way with the **Fundamental Attribution Error**, but the **FAE** gives the idea that we believe situational things are not really that important.
- Some studies have shown that this response is not only for death, but also uncertainty and other fears. There may be a connection between them all; however, for **TMT**, death is the main drive. This also correlates with Thanatos and Freud.

### Self-evaluation maintenance theory (SEM)

- Self-esteem may be raised on the event of success from a close other (**reflection**) and it may also be lowered in the same case (**comparisson**). 
- This means, for instance, that when you are close to other people, you risk the self-esteem being lowered by the process of **comparisson**. This leads to a higher anxiety attack because of the **mortality salience** (the self-esteem shield lowers, meaning you are more succetive to this attack) and may lead to defensive behavior on one's worldview. If this worldview is different from the other peer in the relation, this may lead to fights and the end of the relationship.
- To define whether **reflection** or **comparisson** may occur, **relevance** is an important factor. The more relevant the action that led to the event of success is to one's sense of being, the chance of **comparisson** increases (and the other way around).
- In order to defend our sense of self-worthiness, we try to reduce **relevance**. Say, if one succeeds in a hobby that is important to the other, the other may reduce the importance of such hobby in it's life or find a new hobby. Even, one can try to get away from the other person to avoid the **closensess** that leads to the **comparisson**. The third way is to affect other's performance or sense of self-worth. The healthy way to deal is to use this feeling to enhance the self and try to become as good as - or even try to achieve the same success as the other.
- This may be an explanation to the **friendship paradox**. This paradox states that one individual has less friends on average than their friends have friends. Simply put: your friends have more friends than you do.
- There's also what is known as **vladmir's choice**: humans tend to go for a Maximum Difference (**MD**) instead of maximum profit. This means that individuals tend to prioritize outter-group loses instead of in-group gains. This thing is directly related with **Social Identity Theory (SIT)**, which believes we tend to base our identities on the groups which we belong - this is out **social identity**. Of course, this makes us create a view of *them vs us*, which is a common belief as we categorize people and groups. **SIT** believes our social identity directly correspond with our sense of self-worth (**self-esteem**) and we then need to be good with it. This sense of self-worth is our **positive social identity**, based on comparissons. As **vladmir's choice** shows us,  instead of focusing on the profit for what is called the in-group, we tend to focus on the malefits for the outter-group. It is also believed that the more one identifies with a group, the more the person will likely use **vladmir's choice** for that group.
 
## The "two-factor" theory
- Job satisfaction and job dissatisfaction are not opposed: if you are not satisfied, does not mean you are dissatisfied, vice-versa
- Reminds me of "law of excluded middle"
- Job dissatisfaction is related to salary, stability, vacations; when they are missing, one is dissatisfied; when they are there, one is *not* dissatisfied - which does **not** imply they are satisfied
- Job satisfaction is related to worth,  challenge, feeling as a part of the whole of the organization
- "You get paid well; how are you not satisfied?" is a nice question about this whole
- Another name for it: **Herzberg's motivation-hygiene**
- Motivation is for satisfaction; hygiene, **necessary**, is in order to avoid dissatisfaction

## The "Maslow's Hierarchy of needs"

- Needs are based on a hierarchy
- This hierarchy is made of five (+1) parts: 
	- Phisologycal needs - food, water, clothes, shelter
	- Secutiry needs - wealthiness, home security, health
	- Social needs - being a part of a community or society, fullfiling such role, family, friends, relationships
	- Esteem needs - having a notion of self worth, self esteem; avoiding not being recognized and not being respected (**Side note**: self-esteem is a value judgement over one's self-concept).
	- Self-actualization - this one's driven by a **metaneed**. It is when we as individuals can thrive; our search for creativiness, aesthetics, knowledge.
	- Transedence - holistic view, the cosmos, spirituality.
- The first four levels are known as Deficit-needs, which are not motivating. This needs are also characterized by exterior forces - other people have more weight in these needs than oneself. The top part is for growth needs, and those are more controlled by oneself. **Self-actualized** people have this metamotivation for growth.

### Critiques

- If this is the case, which points out to happy people having fullfilled the first 4 needs and living mostly in the top of the pyramid, how come do we have matrimony issues for wealthy people? Suicide rates are high for the ones who have already fullfilled the fours - mostly in europe, where health and money may not be issues?
